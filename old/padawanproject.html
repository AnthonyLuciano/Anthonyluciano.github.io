		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project's Video Transcription</h2>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;">The project aims to integrate programming education into public schools for children in grades 6 through 9, with the goal of developing creativity and technological skills.<br>
			 The idea is to present programming as a tool that can transform children's lives, offering them a new perspective and future opportunities.<br>
			The project seeks to connect technological knowledge with education, preparing children to become informed citizens ready for the future.<br>
			With programming, they will be able to create their own games and develop their ideas, expanding their intellectual and financial horizons.<br>
			Over the course of two months, a group of about 100 children participated in basic programming classes, using resources such as computers, the internet, and software like Python and Scratch.<br> 
			The project included participatory activities and self-assessments to understand progress and identify areas for improvement.<br>		
			The project addresses the need to modernize education, promoting equity between public and private schools and equipping children with essential technological skills for the 21st century..
